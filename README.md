EMPLOYEE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM !

**CHAPTER 3** 

**INTRODUCTION** 

**1.1  Problem definition** 

Manual handling of employee information poses a number of challenges. The use of paper work in handling some of these processes could lead to human error, papers may end up in the wrong hands and not forgetting the fact that this is time consuming. Another  challenge  is  that  multi-national  companies  will  have  all  the  employee information stored at the headquarters of the company making it difficult to access the employee information from remote places when needed at short notice. 

An  employee  management  system  managed  the  status  of  the  employee,  the educational  background  and  the  work  experience  in  order  to  help  monitor  the performance and achievements of the employee through a password protected system. 

**1.1  Project Objective** 

- Develop a well-designed database to store employee information. 
- Time and cost can be reduced by using the system. 
- A user friendly front-end for the user to interact with the system. 
- Easy retrieval of employee information. 
- Ability to sort employee queries by departments. 
- Remove details of employees no longer working in the organization. 

**1.3  Project scope** 

- Only people in the company can use the system. 
- Employees will have access to their personal profiles and will be able to edit. 
- The HR manager to accept/reject leave application through the system. 
- The admin will add an employee and a default password and employee id will be generated and sent to the new employee’s email. 
- The HR manager will then have the ability to add an employee’s information to the database
